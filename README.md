Devsigner is celebrating the cross-overs, the multi-disciplinarians, the coders who 
paint and the designers who send pull requests — and those who want to develop some 
new left-right brain skills.

We’re looking for folks to break out of their familiar meetup silos and apply their 
knowledge across the crafts of development and design.
